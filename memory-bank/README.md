1. **[`productContext.md`](productContext.md)** - Project overview, technical stack, and architecture
2. **[`activeContext.md`](activeContext.md)** - Current session focus, active tasks, and immediate priorities
3. **[`systemPatterns.md`](systemPatterns.md)** - Design patterns, coding standards, and best practices
4. **[`decisionLog.md`](decisionLog.md)** - Record of design and technical decisions with rationales
5. **[`progress.md`](progress.md)** - Progress tracking, milestones, and success metrics

## Usage Guidelines

### For Development Sessions
1. **Start**: Read [`activeContext.md`](activeContext.md) to understand current priorities
