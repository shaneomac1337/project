**Status**: Implemented
[2025-05-28 20:47:36] - DESIGN-004: Color-Coded Champion Statistics
**Decision**: Implemented intuitive color coding for champion statistics
**Color Scheme Applied**:
- **Difficulty**: Easy/Low (green) ‚Üí Hard/High (red) - intuitive for users (green = good/easy, red = bad/hard)
- **Survivability**: Low (red) ‚Üí High (green) - logical for survival stats (red = danger, green = safe)
**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `data-stat` attributes to distinguish between different stat types
- CSS selectors target specific combinations of `data-stat` and `data-level`
- Maintained existing damage type color coding (Physical = orange, Magic = teal)
**Rationale**: 
- Provides immediate visual feedback about champion characteristics
- Follows intuitive color psychology (green = positive, red = negative/challenging)
- Helps users quickly identify champions matching their skill level and playstyle preferences
**Status**: Implemented
[2025-05-28 20:52:47] - BUGFIX-001: Fixed Color-Coded Stats and Survivability Filter
**Issue**: Color coding wasn't working and survivability filter was broken
**Root Cause**: 
- CSS selectors expected numeric values (data-level="1") but API returns Czech text (data-level="St≈ôedn√≠")
- Filter options used numeric values but champion data uses Czech text values
**Solution Applied**:
- Updated CSS selectors to match Czech text values:
  * Difficulty: "N√≠zk√°" (green), "St≈ôedn√≠" (yellow), "Vysok√°"/"Velmi vysok√°" (red)
  * Survivability: "N√≠zk√°" (red), "St≈ôedn√≠" (yellow), "Vysok√°"/"Velmi vysok√°" (green)
- Updated filter dropdown options to use Czech text values instead of numbers
- Removed .toString() conversion in filter logic to do direct string comparison
**Impact**: Color coding now works correctly and survivability filter is functional
**Status**: Fixed
[2025-05-28 20:55:00] - ENHANCEMENT-001: Visual Progress Bars for Champion Stats
**Decision**: Added progress bar indicators to difficulty and survivability stats
**Visual Design**:
- **Progress Bar Structure**: Thin horizontal bars (4px height) below stat values
- **Fill Levels**: 
  * N√≠zk√°: 25% fill
  * St≈ôedn√≠: 50% fill  
  * Vysok√°: 75% fill
  * Velmi vysok√°: 100% fill
- **Color Coding**: Matches existing color scheme (green=good, yellow=medium, red=challenging)
- **Animation Effects**: Shimmer effect on bars and scale-up on card hover
**Rationale**: 
- Provides immediate visual feedback about stat levels
- Intuitive representation (more fill = higher level)
- Enhances user experience with at-a-glance stat comparison
- Maintains consistency with gaming UI conventions
**Technical Implementation**:
- HTML: Added `.champion-stat-bar` and `.champion-stat-fill` elements
- CSS: Gradient backgrounds, width-based levels, hover animations
- Responsive design with smooth transitions
**Impact**: Improved visual hierarchy and stat readability
**Status**: Implemented
[2025-05-28 20:59:01] - IMPROVEMENT-001: Enhanced Champion Card Image Presentation
**Issue**: Splash art images like Garen's were not optimally positioned, cutting off important character details
**Solution Applied**:
- **Object Position**: Set `object-position: center 25%` to focus on upper portion where character faces/details are typically located
- **Card Height**: Increased from 400px to 450px for better aspect ratio and more image real estate
- **Maintained**: Existing hover effects and transitions for smooth user experience
**Rationale**: 
- League of Legends splash arts are designed with characters prominently featured in upper portions
- 25% vertical positioning captures character faces and key visual elements better than center positioning
- Taller cards provide more space for both image and text content without cramping
**Technical Details**:
- CSS `object-position` property controls which part of the image is visible in the container
- Maintains `object-fit: cover` to prevent image distortion while improving focal point
**Impact**: Better visual presentation of champion artwork with improved character visibility
**Status**: Implemented
[2025-05-28 21:01:27] - BUGFIX-002: Fixed Champion Head Visibility Issue
**Issue**: Champion heads were completely cut off in card images (e.g., Garen's head not visible)
**Root Cause**: Object positioning was still too low even at 25% and 10% vertical positioning
**Solution Applied**: 
- Changed `object-position` from `center 25%` ‚Üí `center 10%` ‚Üí `center top`
- `center top` ensures the very top of splash arts are shown, capturing character heads and faces
**Rationale**: 
- Character recognition is crucial for user experience
- Heads/faces are the most important identifying features
- Better to show top portion even if some lower details are cut off
**Technical Details**:
- `object-position: center top` aligns image to show topmost portion
- Maintains aspect ratio while prioritizing character visibility
- Works across all champion splash arts regardless of composition
**Impact**: All champion cards now properly display character heads and faces
**Status**: Fixed
[2025-05-28 21:02:05] - LIMITATION-001: Champion Splash Art Positioning Challenge
**Issue**: Single object-position value cannot optimize all champion splash arts due to diverse compositions
**Attempted Solutions**:
- `center 25%` - Too low for many champions
- `center 10%` - Still cutting off some heads
- `center top` - Better but not perfect for all compositions
**Root Cause**: 
- LoL splash arts have varied character positioning (center, left, right, top, bottom)
- Some champions are full-body shots, others are close-ups
- Single CSS rule cannot accommodate 160+ unique image compositions
**Potential Future Solutions**:
- Individual object-position per champion (requires extensive manual mapping)
- Dynamic image analysis and positioning
- Alternative card layouts that work better with diverse image compositions
**Current Status**: Using `center top` as best compromise solution
**User Acceptance**: Acknowledged as acceptable limitation
[2025-05-28 21:05:27] - SOLUTION-001: Champion-Specific Image Positioning System
**Implementation**: Created targeted solution for Garen's image positioning issue
**Technical Approach**:
- Added `data-champion` attribute to all champion cards during creation
- Created CSS selector `.champion-card[data-champion="Garen"] .champion-splash img`
- Set Garen's specific positioning to `object-position: right top`
**Scalability**: 
- System now allows individual positioning rules for any champion
- Can easily add more champion-specific rules as needed
- Maintains general `center top` positioning for all other champions
**Code Structure**:
- JavaScript: `card.setAttribute('data-champion', champion.name)`
- CSS: Champion-specific selectors override general positioning
**Impact**: Garen's image should now properly show his head/face positioned from the right side
**Future Use**: Template for fixing other problematic champion images individually
**Status**: Implemented for Garen
[2025-05-28 21:07:49] - FINAL-FIXES: Position Badges and Fizz Image Positioning
**Issues Addressed**:
1. Position badges stretching when champions have multiple roles

   - Reduced font-size from `0.75rem` to `0.7rem`
   - Added `white-space: nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
   - Added `flex-shrink: 0` and `min-width: fit-content` for proper sizing
   - Smaller border-radius (12px vs 15px) for cleaner look

2. **Fizz Image Positioning**:
   - Added Fizz to champion-specific positioning rules
   - Set `object-position: right top` to show his character properly

**Issue**: Position badges (MID, JUNGLE) looked stretched and awkward when stacked vertically for multi-role champions
**Visual Problem**: Badges were too large and spaced out, creating an unbalanced appearance in the top-right corner
**Solution Applied**:
- **Container**: Reduced gap from 6px to 4px, added max-width: 80px constraint
- **Badge Size**: Reduced padding from 4px 8px to 3px 6px for more compact appearance
- **Typography**: Reduced font-size from 0.7rem to 0.65rem for better proportion
- **Border Radius**: Reduced from 12px to 10px for tighter, cleaner look
- **Layout**: Added text-align: center and line-height: 1 for consistent spacing
**Impact**:
